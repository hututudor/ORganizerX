### What is our application doing?
At the moment it does nothing because the components have not been linked yet.
### What is our progress?
We managed to make the UI in Unity and to find a lot of 3D objects on the internet. Among these objects, we also found a very well-made operating room, but we did not manage to bring it into Unity because of a problem with the textures. Even if some objects came with textures, we will have to color most of them.
### What is our purpose for the next week?
We would like to solve the problem with the operating room so that we can export it to Unity and put it together with the UI. We will use this room as a demo and after the Week 9 presentation we'll modify it. We should also model other objects that we will need and color those that we found.
